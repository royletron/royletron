What we want to do next is elevate this plain\nlooking content into something amazing, and to do that we need CSS.</p>\n<h2>Syntaxing CSS</h2>\n<p>CSS is a technology built into most modern browsers that allows web developers\nto style the content that they have sent to users. Your browser will take the\nHTML and the CSS - which is usally a file called a ‘stylesheet’ - and then\nprocess the CSS on top of the HTML to render what it is the developer wanted it\nto look like. This means that the CSS directly references the HTML that it was\nbuilt for, and contains code that defines the ‘style’. So let’s take a look at\nsome</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"css\"><pre class=\"language-css\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token selector\">body</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">background</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> orange<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">color</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> blue<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>A CSS style as shown above (this is a single style - you can write as many as\nyou want) has two parts, the first bit is the ‘selector’ - in the above case\n<code class=\"language-text\">body</code> - and this tells the browser what elements it should apply this style\ntoo. The second part is the bit inside <code class=\"language-text\">{ }</code> which is the ‘declaration block’ and\nlists all of the CSS ‘properties’ this style wants to change and their value -\nthis is always <code class=\"language-text\">property: value;</code> ensuring the <code class=\"language-text\">;</code> at the end of each individual\ndeclaration.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Lesson 4 - CSS!","date":"March 16, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/lesson-4/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/lesson-3/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Lesson 3 - Document Object Model (DOM)"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/lesson-5/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Lesson 4 - The Box Model"}}}}

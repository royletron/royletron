I've loved video games for as long as I can remember, and throughout that time there have been some real standout moments of gaming joy. For me the real crackers are the ones that live up to the image that I have of them in my head before playing. As a serial planner, I spend quite a lot of time researching, reading reviews, comments and speaking to friends before I buy a game. When I was little this was because of the financial neccesity of only being able to afford a few games a year, but now it's more about _time_. I don't have the time to play every game that comes out, so I want to make sure that the ones I do play are **worth** it.

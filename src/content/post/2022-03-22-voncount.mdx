title: Von Count
description: I vant to count your lines!
excerpt: We recently found need to count lines of our code, but with added context that things like `cloc` can't give us. Basically at a glance we wanted to see the use of certain features/components/libraries so that we could phase them out slowly over time and see progress 🧮.

To that end [we produced _VonCount_](https://github.com/ventureharbour/voncount)

**VonCount** produces tables of results for folders of source code, those results are determined by an optional configuration. The configuration can decide any number of `groups` which are named and are specified by patterns that match the start and end of a particular block of something. For example _documentation_ where you want to count lines between `/**` and `*/`:

```json title="count.json"
{
  "groups": [
    {
      "name": "documentation",
      "between": {
        "start": "^\\/\\*\\*",
        "end": "^ \\*/$"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

These will then be matched and counted alongside the rest of the source, producing a table that shows total lines, number of lines in your groups and the representation as a % of those groups.

```bash
npm install -g voncount
voncount run .
┌────────────────┬───────┬─────────────────┬───────┐
│ Path           │ Lines │ 'documentation' │     % │
├────────────────┼───────┼─────────────────┼───────┤
│ test           │   232 │              19 │  8.19 │
│   components   │   207 │              19 │  9.18 │
│     Header.js  │    18 │               4 │ 22.22 │
│     Content.js │   179 │              15 │  8.38 │
│     Footer.js  │    10 │               0 │     0 │
│   pages        │    25 │               0 │     0 │
│     index.js   │    25 │               0 │     0 │
└────────────────┴───────┴─────────────────┴───────┘

```

And you get a neat breakdown of it all 🚀!

_We are still pretty early_ with our build on this, but feel it's useful so will be investing more and more time into it. It's great for developer led metrics, and removing/adding certain facets to your code base [give it a try](https://www.npmjs.com/package/voncount).

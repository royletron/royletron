title: Baldur's Gate 3
description: My new life as Asterion.
excerpt: |
  My time in Baldur's Gate 3 has been a whirlwind of emotions and the most surreal situations I have ever encounted in a videogame. From working out who murdered a clown, to deciding the fate of 7,000 vampires - it's been a wild ride from start to finish.

I was given Baldur's Gate 3 by my partner as a whimsy Christmas present. I had done the research and heard all of the good things but I had already decided that I was going to give a while to get a little cheaper before jumping in. I was wrong. I was so wrong. I should have been playing this game from day one.


### Quick Primer

I had heard of but never really got into the previous iterations of Baldur's Gate, so it's worth giving a quick run down of what it is about. Effectively, it's pretty much the only official Dungeons and Dragons game that has broke mainstream popularity - and that's because it plays very much like it's pen and paper counterpart. It's a top down, isometric RPG with a heavy focus on story and character development. It's a game that is very much about the journey and not the destination, where the choices along the way all contribute to where you go and what you do. The mechanics and the lore are all very much D&D, so if you're a fan of the tabletop game, you'll feel right at home - but if you're not, maybe this will help you see what all the fuss is about.

### My Story

So to start off with you're presented with the ability to create your own character. I personally decided to take one of the pre-canned mainline characters, **Asterion**, as I wanted to get into the game as quickly as possible - I had alread read a lot about his story line and thought it would be a hoot. Asterion is a _high-elf_ and happens to be a _vampire_. He's a rogue - which makes him a little bit of a coniving back-stabbing kind of guy - and I always love the idea of sneaking about and taking people out before they have time to react. The choice of pre-canned characters gives a good selection of other classes and play styles, from full on mages that cast powerful spells, to definsive clerics and strong weapon laden warriors. The game is very much about choice and you can play it however you want.

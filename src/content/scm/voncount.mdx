There have been many times where we wanted to perform some sort of metric analysis to count instances of specific coding styles or patterns. The idea was `voncount`, named after the Count Von Count of course, would check a repository of files and return statistics on the number of occurancies of particular things. Using this, we were able to provide a percentage of the usage of a particular thing, and hopefully see that number go up or down. For example, if you wanted to deprecate the use of `!important` in your CSS files, you could create a configuration that would give you that percentage as a number, then set an objective for the team to lower that!

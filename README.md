# ðŸ‘‹ Hey I'm Darren!

Since receiving my first ZX Spectrum aged 6 I have been building and creating things with computers. Over the last 15 years I have built commercial software for desktop, mobile and full stack web applications - for a 500 year old company with 2k employees through to a startup with just 3. I've made 2D adventure games, cutting edge AI code writers, a desktop productivity tool, and a homework portal with 5 million users - to name just a few. I am forever learning and love the challenge of new projects, always trying to produce something special.

Ok so I want to share as many secrets as I can about how to become a web
developer as quickly as possible. This will be written up in a series of posts,
and the order will be important. I am going to start from absolute first
principles - you only need to know you own a computer and have visited a website
previously. All the way to doing client UI completely in Javascript (basic
front-end developer job work) and writing backend services in NodeJS (basic
back-end developer job work). At the point those two things diverge I will work
out some clever numbering.

## Why?

That is a completely reasonable question. I guess the answer is because I know a
lot of people are put off and they really shouldn't be. Being a developer is a
doddle, and is really rewarding both as a career and as a hobby. I think
everyone should have access to the resources and tools to do it - so this is my
small part to bring that home.

## Who even are you?

I am a web developer who has worked on a number of huge projects, both backend,
frontend and combined. At the moment I work for a company running their SaaS
Team (software as a service) and have been doing it for almost 15 years
(development, not this particular job). I love what I do and I happen to think I
am quite good at telling others why it is so special.

## OK I am in, where do I start.

Well, with the first post...
